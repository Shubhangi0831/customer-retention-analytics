# Customer Retention Analytics - Telecom Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Machine learning solution predicting telecom customer churn with 79% accuracy, enabling proactive retention strategies and revenue protection through data-driven customer insights.

## Business Problem
Telecommunications companies face significant revenue loss due to customer churn. Early identification of at-risk customers enables targeted retention efforts and protects recurring revenue streams.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn dataset
- **Records:** Customer behavioral and service usage data
- **Target:** Binary churn prediction (Yes/No)

## Key Findings
- **Low tenure customers** show significantly higher churn probability
- **Higher monthly charges** correlate with increased churn likelihood  
- **Fiber optic users** demonstrate elevated churn rates
- **New customers** most vulnerable during initial service period

## Model Performance
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy:** 79%
- **Business Value:** Enables identification of at-risk customers for proactive retention
